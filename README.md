 Have you ever put somethig safely away, only to forget where you put it when you need it? 

 Are you tired of your family members asking you where things are all the time? 

 You carefully arranged gradma's heirloom Christmas decor in a box and put said box in one of many storage places in your home.Then, a year later, when you are looking for them, you vaguely remember putting them in a beatiful decorated box, but not if the box is in the attic, the garage, or one of the many closets in the house. 


 Your husband is looking for the wine opener in the kitchen.... again. He needs you to remind him where it is stored  for the 100th time. 

 This small application is designed to aid with  such  problems.  It is meant to keep track of all those rarely used items that are put away and easily forgotten. 

 There are two parts to it.  The first, allows you to "store" an item away. Completing this form updateds a database, allowing the page to "save" the location of the object you stored.  In storing the object the application asks for the location an object will be stored in and other information about it, such as category or room. This will allow users to search for items by category or room, in case they are not sure what the name of the items is. 

 The second part of the application is the item search. Users are able to search by name, category or room. The results are displayed at the bottom of the page. Users can then click on an item to see the items information displayed on a table.
